- 👋 Hi, I’m @desiblues
- 👀 I’m interested in AI for music appreciation, particularly हिन्दुस्तानी (Hindustani) शास्त्रीय (classical) गायन (vocal)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning just about all of that - Hindustani, musicology, and AI in this space
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI for Hindustani music: channel separation of various instruments and vocals, instrument and कलाकार (artist) identification, राग (rāg) & ताल (tāl) identification, घराना (gharāna) identification, real time स्वरलिपि (swaralipi), generative संगीत (sangeet) that confirms to gharāna and artist, ... yes, that and more, Hindustani is the door!
- 📫 How to reach me: [hmm](mailto:121408866+desiblues@users.noreply.github.com).
